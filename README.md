code for RL mazes.

create_mazes.py create random block mazes with various parameters (size, ratio, i/o count...)

we created a simple Q-learning check to verify if they are all completable.


basic_maze_solution.py show an example of a maze and the solution for it.

qtabletrainno_base25.py show a basic example of reading a folder of mazes and solving each one.
